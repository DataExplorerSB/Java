# Objects and Classes
## Object:
1. An entity that has **states** (attributes/properties) and **behavior** is known as an object like car, chair, pen etc.
2. Real world entity which we can touch and feel.
3. Each Objects has unique identity : Properties and Behavior.
4. **Example:** Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking,
fetching, wagging tail).
## Class:
1. Blueprint from which individual objects are created. Blueprint is like creating design/ map before building a house. So, if any properties or behavior is mentioned in classs, the objects created from class will get the same properties and behavior as like mentioned in the blueprint i.e in class
2. Class is a collection of objects. It is possible create multiple objects from a class.
3. Class can have **properties** and **behaviors** declared
4. Object is instance of class. Therefore the properties and behaviors declared in class, the objects created from this class will have the same properties nad behaviors. The values of these properties could be different, but objects will have same properties and behaviors as like the class.
